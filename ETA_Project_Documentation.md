```python
# Data loading and merging
df_cq = pd.read_csv('Pickup Five Cities Datasets/pickup_cq.csv')
df_hz = pd.read_csv('Pickup Five Cities Datasets/pickup_hz.csv')
df_jl = pd.read_csv('Pickup Five Cities Datasets/pickup_jl.csv')

#### A.2 Feature Engineering

```python
# Time feature extraction
df['hour'] = df['pickup_time'].dt.hour
df['day'] = df['pickup_time'].dt.day
df['weekday'] = df['pickup_time'].dt.weekday
df['is_weekend'] = df['weekday'] >= 5

# Duration calculations
df['actual_pickup_duration'] = (df['pickup_time'] - df['accept_time']).dt.total_seconds() / 60
df['pickup_delay_vs_window'] = (df['pickup_time'] - df['time_window_end']).dt.total_seconds() / 60
df['window_length'] = (df['time_window_end'] - df['time_window_start']).dt.total_seconds() / 60
```
